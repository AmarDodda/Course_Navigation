# React + Vite

This task involves setting up navigation and defining a default route for a React application using React Router. The goal is to create a navigation menu with links to different courses/pages and ensure that the desired content is displayed when the application loads.

The courses involved are: FULL STACK WEB DEVOLOPMENT, DATA SCIENCE, CYBER SECURITY , in each category three courses were displayed.

Used the <Link> component from React Router to create the navigation links. It is used to create navigation links that automatically handle route changes without causing a full page reload.

Made All componenet as a default route to ensure that the website gets directed to a specific page(All) when initially accessing the application or when the URL is given.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
